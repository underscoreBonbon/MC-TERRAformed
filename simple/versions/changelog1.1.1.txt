* WORLDGEN MOD, THE STRUCTURES/LOOT ITEMS ONLY APPEAR IN NEW CHUNKS!!!

This Update took days to do because of me trying to find mods that make vanilla better without obscuring it.
This update's theme is to build on top of existing features, and I think I went TOO FAR by nerfing mending!

Also, your existing worlds might break... so make a backup if needed!

MAKE SURE TO WIPE YOUR WORLD'S SERVER CONFIG FILES!!!!!
